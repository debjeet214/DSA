* SPARSE MATRIX : A sparse matrix is a special case of a matrix in which the number of zero elements is much higher than the number of non-zero elements.
                 As a rule of thumb, if 2/3 of the total elements in a matrix are zeros, it can be called a sparse matrix.

* REQUIRMENTS : 
              1. storage: a sparse matrix contains lesser non-zero elements than zero elements, so less memory can be used
              2. Computing time : we need to travers non zero elements only, rather than traversing all the sparse matrix elements, it saves computing time by logically 
                                  data structure traversing non-elements 

** ARRAY REPRESENTATION OF THE SPARSE MATRIX: 
  1. A sparse matrix using a 2-D array leads to the wastage of lots of memory
2. as we store zero matrix, so empty space will created and wastage of memory will happen.
